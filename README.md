<p>This website will make it easy for me to create commit changes so I can adjust the page for future use.</p>

<h3 id="markdown">More About Me</h3>

<p>I am a first-year college student; my major is cloud computing and cybersecurity. I am currently trying to learn Python and JavaScript programming languages. This web page is my first attempt at learning coding for my classes, so please bear with me.  I am eager to learn new ways to improve my professional skills. </p>
